# Find the Nearest Number in TouchDesigner
Example of a way to find the nearest number in a dataset/table in TouchDesigner

By no means is this meant to be efficient, just the first way I thought of using Python scripting

Notes:

* This example has a lot of print outs to confirm the code is working - they can be removed
* This example uses a CHOP Execute because it was the easiest for me to test it that way, but should work in other script-based DATs
